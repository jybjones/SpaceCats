For my first capstone, I decided to try a new framework called Phaser. I just started to learn to code 3 months ago, so still very new to this world!

V.1 was setup to test this new framework and functionality. Currently, a user will have 30 seconds, or 9 lives, to shoot lasers at the enemy, Doge, which is a sprite sheet I also created using Photoshop.

Future versions will have other features such as different levels of difficulty and a leaderboard.

Enjoy!
